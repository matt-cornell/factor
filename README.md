# Factor
Name is WIP. In fact, this whole thing is, but shhhh, don't tell anyone!

Factor is an open-world factory builder game. Basically, you're put on a planet and build factories to manufacture products.

## Installation
This is a Rust project, so you can use `cargo` to build and run. The main package contains an app with full single- and multiplayer, the `factor-client` package contains a slimmed-down version that only has a client, and `factor-server` is a slimmed-down version for a headless server.

Eventually, I'll have CI build releases, but there isn't much to release as of right now.
